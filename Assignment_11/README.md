# Assignment 11: Basic Calculator

## Objective
Create a basic calculator that can perform the four fundamental arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Requirements
1. Implement separate functions for each arithmetic operation
2. Create a user-friendly interface for input and output
3. Handle potential errors (like division by zero)
4. Make sure the calculator continues running until the user chooses to exit

## Instructions
1. Run the calculator program: `python calculator.py`
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations
3. Enter the operation you want to perform by selecting a number
4. Input the required numbers when prompted
5. View the result
6. Continue with more calculations or exit

## Bonus Challenge
- Extend the calculator to include additional operations (square root, exponents, etc.)
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs
- Add a history feature to recall previous calculations
